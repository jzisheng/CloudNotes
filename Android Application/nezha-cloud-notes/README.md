MyCloud Notes is a cross platform server based note storing program. 

Adding a note is as simple as filling out the text field and pressing add, and you can also add notes from the website and have them show up on the phone. Users can register to create an account that will store their notes.

To delete a note just press down and hold over the note, at which point a prompt will show up to delete it. At the present time the desktop version has no delete function.

While the mobile version will not allow for duplicate notes, the computer version will.

to test the application without creating an account, use the following:
Username: testuser
Password: password

To access the desktop version, use the url:
